Full Circle Magazine (FCM) started a Python tutorial series in issue #27. 
It would be nice to extract these tutorials from the issues and put them 
together in a single PDF. Thus, we would have all the tutorials together 
in one document.

Usage:

./01-get-issues.sh
    Download the necessary FCM issues. Issue #28 has a different name,
    the script will rename it.
./01b-get-latest-issue.sh
    It'll only download the latest issue.

./02-extract.py python.csv
    The file python.csv specifies which pages to extract from the issues.
    You can write your own series.csv file (ex.: gimp.csv) to extract
    a different series.

./03-combine-pieces.py python.csv
    Combine the pieces together in a single PDF. Location of the result:
    python/result/all.pdf.
    If you combine the pieces with Adobe Acrobat Pro, the size of the
    resulting file will be very small. Pdftk produces a much larger file.

ebook_edition/fetch.py
    Fetch e-book edition issues in .epub format.
